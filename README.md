### Using available CSS animations
We are all set, to use it with default `rotating_square` animation in any view file ( for e.g.: index.html.erb) just add:
```
<%= loading_screen %>
```

There are also other loading animation available for you to choose from just add `style` option, like:

```
<%= loading_screen style: :double_bounce %>
```

```
<%= loading_screen style: :rectangle_bounce %>
```

Other animations will be available shortly...

### Using custom gif images

if you want to add custom gif as the loading screen just download a gif and put it inside the `assets/images/` and add `gif` option:
```

You can change the color of the css animation and also the background of the loader just add `color` option:
