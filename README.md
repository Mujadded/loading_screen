### Using available CSS animations
We are all set, to use it with default `rotating_square` animation in any view file ( for e.g.: index.html.erb) just add:
```
<%= loading_screen %>
```
or 
```
<%= loading_screen style: :default %>
```

There are also other loading animation available for you to choose from just add `style` option, like:

```
<%= loading_screen style: :double_bounce %>
```

```
<%= loading_screen style: :rectangle_bounce %>
```

```
<%= loading_screen style: :wandering_cubes %>
```

```
<%= loading_screen style: :cube_grid %>
```

Other animations will be available shortly...

### Using custom gif images

if you want to add custom gif as the loading screen just download a gif and put it inside the `assets/images/` and add `gif` option:
```
<%= loading_screen gif: 'your gif file name witout ".gif" ' %>
```
And you are done. Enjoy

### Using custom colors

You can change the background color and the loader color ( color for only css animation loader, gif's color depends on the image ) by adding `background` option and `color` option:

```
<%= loading_screen color: 'red', background: 'green' %>
```
Color format like `hash`, `rgb`, `rgba`, etc  all css color format are acceptable

## Development

Currently only fullscreen loading animation is supported. `Div` based loading animation feature will be added soon.
