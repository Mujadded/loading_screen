### Using available CSS animations
We are all set, to use it with default `rotating_square` animation in any view file ( for e.g.: index.html.erb) just add:
```
<%= loading_screen %>
```

There are also other loading animation available for you to choose from, like:

```
<%= loading_screen style: :double_bounce %> 
```
Other animations will be available shortly...

### Using custom gif images

if you want to add custom gif as the loading screen just download a gif and put it inside the `assets/images/` and add: 
```
<%= loading_screen gif: 'your gif file name witout ".gif" ' %>
```
And you are done. Enjoy !
## Development

Currently only fullscreen loading animation is supported. `Div` based loading animation feature will be added soon.
